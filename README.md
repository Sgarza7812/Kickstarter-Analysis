# Analysis of Outcomes by Launch Date and Goals

## Overview of Project

-Louise was wanting an analysis of how the Category Theater and Subcategory Plays did when looking at the month of the Launch Date and Goals set for each play.

### Purpose

-The purpose of the project was to see if the month the Kickstarter was launched on and if the amount the Goal was set at played a part in the Kickstarter being successful, canceled, or failed.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

-I preformed the analysis of Outcomes by Launch Date by creating a pivot table with Parent Category and Years as the Filters, Month of Date Created Conversion for the Rows, Outcomes were set as Columns and Values. From the pivot table, I then created a line graph that showed the count of Outcomes for each Month. ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch] (Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

-I preformed the analysis of Outcomes Based on Goal Amount by breaking the goal amount into groupings then finding the percentage of Successful and Failed campaigns. I found the percentage by taking the number of successful and failed campaigns for each amount grouping then divided by the total number in each grouping. Then based on the percentages of successful and failed, I created a line graph to show which groupings had the highest success rate and failed rate. ![Outcomes_vs_Goals] (Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

-The challenges I faced while performing the analysis of the outcomes for launch date and goal amounts is that the launch date outcomes was based on the parent category of theater while goal amount was based on the subcategory of plays. Therefore, the launch date outcomes have more information we can look at than the goal amounts and we did not look at the goal amounts for each month to see if there is a connection for what ended up successful or failed. We could have also used a Clustered Column-Line graph to show the outcomes for each analysis.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-The months of May and June had the highest rate of success
-The month of December had the lowest rate of success

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-I can conclude that the goal amounts between $0 to $24,999 have at least a 45 percent chance of succeeding while goals over $25,000 have a higher rate of failing.
